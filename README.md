## Setup new machine

```
brew install npm
brew install yarn
yarn global add react-scripts
yarn global add nodemon
```

## Deploying to heroku (deploys the static app not the container)

`heroku login`
`git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/shrouded-peak-45691.git`
`heroku config:set REACT_APP_SERVER_API_URL=https://still-fjord-81783.herokuapp.com`
`git push heroku master`
`heroku open`

To view the app directly:
<https://shrouded-peak-45691.herokuapp.com/ >

Testing the app locally outside of docker from the project directory run
`yarn install`
`REACT_APP_SERVER_API_URL=<wherever your api is listening, by default should be http://localhost:8080> yarn start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Application API

The application connects to an NodeJS API to load flight information using an environment variable called REACT_APP_SERVER_API_URL

An example would be <http://localhost:8080>

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
